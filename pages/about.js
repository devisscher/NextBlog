    <h2 className="page-header">About Me</h2>
    <p>Welcome to my website. You will find a collection of notes, articles, thoughts, and projects that I have worked on.</p>
    <p>I’m the type of guy who loves the nitty gritty work involved in making good things happen. I love to work with others on fun projects, don’t hesitate to contact me!</p>
    <p>When I’m not programming or outdoors cycling, skiing, camping, canoeing or walking my dog you might find me hanging out with friends enjoying a few brews or, sleeping.</p>
