This is a great recipe for asian style chicken.

- 1 table spoon of fresh ginger
- 1 table spoon of sesame oil 
- 1 table spoon of rice wine vinegar
- 1/4 cup of soy sauce
- 3 table spoons of honey
- 2 cloves of garlic minced

In a ziploc bag, mix the ingredients and the chicken and marinate up to 4 hours.
