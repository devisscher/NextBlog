This is a traditional dish that my grand-ma and mom make. 


## Meat filling

- 3 lbs of ground pork
- 3 lbs of ground veal or beef
- 4 cloves of garlic
- 4 onions, diced
- 1 teaspoon of all-spice
- salt and pepper

Brown onions and garlic with a bit of olive oil in a large pot. Add meat and cook for about 45 mins and let cool.

## Dough

- 2 1/4 cups of flour
- 3/4 cups of butter
- 6 tablespoons of ice water

Blend the butter into the flour and add the water slowly until you can form a ball. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 mins.
