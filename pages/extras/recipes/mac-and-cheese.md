Delicious home made creamy mac and cheese.

- 2 cups of milk
- 2 cups of cheese
- 1/4 cup of butter
- 1/4 cup of flour

## Roux 

Melt butter into a sauce pan, add flour then milk and bring to a light boil. Lower the heat immediately as the milk starts to boil. Add the cheese and incorporate into the milk. It should get thick and creamy.

## Pasta

Add the sauce to the pasta, sprinkle with more cheese and breadcrumbs to your liking. Roast in the oven too if you want.
