Well, Gatsby was nice, but I didn't feel great about it. No offense to anyone who is working on Gatsby, it is a great system. I made the switch because I came across this framework called [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/). I was immediately seduced by the way it proposes to do things. Additionally it provides a complete deployment workflow which takes away the hassle of configuring all that. Thank you to the folks at [Zeit](https://zeit.co/), your work is phenomenal. As I don't wish to spend all my time working on my blog, I felt the switch would make my life easier. Hopefully this decision will last a little while.

## Some cool things to mention about next

- By using a custom server configuration, you can serve static assets such as markdown posts
- Each component and or folder containing a component within the pages directory will render a React component.
- Deploying is as simple as typing ``` now ```
- I'm using Milligram CSS framework which relies heavily on Flexbox for layouts. This makes the grid system really slick and intuitive.

Again this is a WIP as are all my blogs and websites. Changing platforms is a recurring theme so here is a list of posts which talk about my older sites.
