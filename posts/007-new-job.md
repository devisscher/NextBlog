After a few years as a developer I finally landed a job at a software company. I've had the opportunity to work for public and para-public institutions and in these roles I learned a lot about software development. The main take away for me is how much work there is in software. 

What is the difference between working for a software company and a public institution or company who's mandate isn't solely based in software and technology?

1. As stated, the mandate is different. Software development isn't the main focus for public institutions, they take care of things like finding a cure for cancer and protecting citizens from crime. Naturally, technology isn't the top priority.

2. The result is using tools and systems that aren't necessarily bleeding edge. 

3. The development process is loosely implemented, meaning organizations look for quick integration without thorough testing or review. Something that software companies can't afford to do. When you're developing software for thousands or hundreds of thousand customers you can't simply ship code without testing it.

4. Integration over development. In a business where software isn't the main focus, I would argue that integration presents less risk and costs less than development of custom solutions.
