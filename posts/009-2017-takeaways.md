2017 was a great year, here are some of the great tools, technologies and resources that I was lucky to discover. The following haven't all been released in 2017, but they've been significant in my work as a developer this year, this is why I chose to share them here: 

### 1. [Syntax.fm](https://syntax.fm/) 

A weekly podcast by Wes Bos and Scott Tolinski where they give listeners tasty web-development treats. This is a great show and I'm impatient about each new episode. It usually comes out on Wednesday. I highly recommend it. 

### 2. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

I'm not the first and probably won't be the last to make the switch but Visual Studio Code is where it's at. I love the extensions ecosystem and the feel of the app. I was using WebStorm and Sublime Text beforehand, these are great editors but I feel VS Code is lighter and faster, easier to set up and overall a great app. Sublime is still amazingly fast and useful for quick text edits. 

### 3. [Zeit.co](https://zeit.co/)

This german company impressed me with the relevance of their product offering. I am using 2 of their products currently, Next.js(The framework on which this blog built) and Now.sh(The deployment service that is provisioning this blog). 

Next.js: is a server rendered react app which allows you to easily build pages as components. This approach is quick and easy, it lends itself well to a blog or other content websites. 

Now.sh: is a service that allows you to host websites and applications with one command, `now`. Every time you deploy a project you are given a URL to which you point a custom domain by using the `alias` command. 

### 4. [Mongo DB](https://www.mongodb.com/) and [Studio 3T](https://studio3t.com)

MongoDB is by far the most popular noSQL database on the market right now. I was fortunate enough to attend MongoDB World in Chicago, where I learned a lot about MongoDB capabilities. The knowledge I acquired there has contributed to increasing the quality with which I can deliver applications. The main takeaway for me is the Aggregation framework which allows you to manipulate your data with accuracy, in addition Studio 3T, a MongoDB client software allows you to create complex queries with ease. Diving deep into MongoDB is a must for modern app developers.

### 5. [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios)

Axios is a promised based HTTP library. It replaces the use of XHR and jQuery http requests. It goes along well with React and other Node.js use cases. Axios is 14.2K and jQuery is 86.6K so you can reduce your bundle size in the end. Having a promise based HTTP library also provides assurance that your requests will return a response which is handy. I mostly used this library within React components to fetch data from APIs.

Those are my top 5 takeaways from 2017, I look forward to the things I'll learn in 2018. That's a wrap! ðŸŽ‰
