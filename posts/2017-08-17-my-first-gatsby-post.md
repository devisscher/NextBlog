It was time. My Jekyll site was getting old and I felt like I was hacking all kinds of things together to achieve the results I was looking for. Gatsby is a new static site generator which has gained a lot of traction in recent months, so I'm going to make the switch. Notable improvements for me are numerous: 

- **JavaScript** for everything.
- Open to **different data sources** through GraphQL. I could use MongoDB, REST apis, Drupal or WordPress.
- **Rich plugins**, like a Sass. This blog is a mix between Sass and styled components. Something about object notation in CSS is interesting to me.
- Extremely fast page load. Achieved **page speed 100**!
- **Structured approach**(No spaghetti code i.e. Adding javascript to single posts). At first I thought this would be a limitation because I do have older posts which made use of JavaScript for things like charts or including Gists. But after some thought I believe removing this haphazardly placed JS will improve the overall experience for me as a developer and for the reader as it won't affect page load time. For whenever I wish to write a post that contains JavaScript a simple workaround will be to create a component, which will then become an ordinary page, as per the way Gatsby renders the site.

Gatsby is an awesome platform and I highly recommend it! Check out its [website](https://www.gatsbyjs.org), join the [Discord channel](https://discordapp.com/invite/0ZcbPKXt5bZjGY5n) or watch this tutorial by [Scott Tolinski](http://scotttolinski.com/) on his Youtube channel [LevelUpTuts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2H7fWhQcdE).

As time goes by I will be moving some of my older posts to this blog and I will obviously be writing more posts. Welcome to my new Gatsby blog!
