Well, Gatsby was nice, but I didn't feel great about it. No offense to anyone who is working on Gatsby, it is a great system. I made the switch because I came across this framework called [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/). I was immediately seduced by the way it proposes to do things. Additionally it provides a complete deployment workflow which takes away the hassle of configuring all that. Thank you to the folks at [Zeit](https://zeit.co/), your work is phenomenal. As I don't wish to spend all my time working on my blog, I felt the switch would make my life easier. Hopefully this decision will last a little bit.
